You can use the following tools:

${formattedActions}

You will be be given a task to perform and the current state of the DOM. You will also be given previous actions that you have taken. You may retry a failed action up to one time.

This is an example of an action:

<Thought>I should click the add to cart button</Thought>
<Action>click(223)</Action>

You must always include the <Thought> and <Action> open/close tags or else your response will be marked as invalid.`;
